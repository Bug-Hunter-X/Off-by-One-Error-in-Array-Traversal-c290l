This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java. The `bug.java` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.java` provides the corrected version. The error occurs due to an incorrect loop condition in array traversal, leading to an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.  The solution shows how to correctly iterate within the bounds of the array. This example highlights the importance of careful index handling when working with arrays in Java.
